# Firmware Updates

The device checks for firmware updates automatically and can install them over-the-air — no USB cable or reflashing needed. Update behavior is fully controllable from the device page in Home Assistant.

## How it works

The device periodically checks for a new firmware version from the project's GitHub Pages manifest. When an update is available:

- If **Auto Update** is enabled, the firmware is installed automatically.
- If **Auto Update** is disabled, the update appears in Home Assistant as available but is not installed until you choose to.

The check frequency is controlled by the **Update Frequency** setting. Between checks, the device counts hourly intervals and only contacts the server when the threshold is reached, keeping network traffic minimal.

## Settings

All settings are available on the device page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device).

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Auto Update** | When enabled, firmware updates are installed automatically as soon as they are detected. When disabled, updates are reported but not installed. Default: on. |
| **Update Frequency** | How often the device checks for updates: **Hourly**, **Daily** (default), or **Weekly**. |
| **Firmware Update** | Shows the current and latest firmware versions. When an update is available, a standard Home Assistant update card appears with an **Install** button and progress bar. |
| **Install Latest Firmware** | Manually triggers an update check and install. Useful when auto-update is off or you want to install immediately without waiting for the next scheduled check. |

## Updating manually

If auto-update is disabled, you can update at any time:

1. Open the device page in Home Assistant.
2. Press the **Install Latest Firmware** button to check for the latest version.
3. If an update is available, the **Firmware Update** entity will show the new version — click **Install** to apply it.

The device will download the new firmware, flash it, and reboot automatically. This typically takes 1–2 minutes depending on your network speed.

::: tip
During the firmware update the screen will flash — this is completely normal. It should last about 30 seconds before the device reboots. Just let it finish.

## Disabling automatic updates

Toggle the **Auto Update** switch off on the device page. The device will still check for updates on the configured schedule, but will only report availability without installing. You can install manually at any time using the steps above.
