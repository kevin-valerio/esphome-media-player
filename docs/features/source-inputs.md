# Source Inputs

![TV Source](../images/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1-tvsource.jpg)

If your speaker has a source input — such as a **TV** (soundbars like Sonos Beam or Arc with HDMI) or **Line In** (speakers and amps like Sonos Five, Play:5, Port, or Amp with a 3.5mm/RCA input) — the controller can display now-playing info from the media player connected to that input. This feature is entirely optional — the controller works without it.

> [!WARNING]
> This feature is in **beta**. If you encounter any issues, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jtenniswood/esphome-media-player/issues).

## How it works

- **Automatic switching** — when the speaker's active source changes to "TV" or "Line In", the UI switches to show title, artist, artwork, and progress from the media player connected to that input. When the source changes back, the UI reverts to the primary player.
- **Idle state** — when the source input's media player is idle, off, or on standby, the screen displays the source name ("TV" or "Line In") on a black background with playback controls hidden. Controls reappear when playback starts again.
- **Routed controls** — play/pause, next, and previous are automatically sent to whichever player is active (music or source input).

## Setup

On the device page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device), set the **Source Input Media Player** field to the entity ID of the media player connected to your input (e.g. `media_player.apple_tv`).

Leave this field empty to disable the feature.

## Compatibility

This feature works with any speaker that exposes a "TV" or "Line In" source attribute and any media player entity in Home Assistant.

Tested with:

- **TV** (soundbars): Sonos Beam, Sonos Arc
- **Line In** (speakers/amps): Sonos Five, Sonos Play:5, Sonos Amp, Sonos Port
- **Source input media players**: Apple TV, Chromecast
